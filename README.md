# Free vs Paid - Flutter: Civil War
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are developing your own application? Have you estimated how much time and money you will spend on it?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> I know how much time it takes to develop a mobile app. The application development takes on average from 3 to 9 months. I know this from personal experience. The development stages include many steps: writing code, creating a design, testing bugs, editing, and finally testing the application itself. Every step costs time and money, which is why the cost of the application grows. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all customers are ready to pay well for the work on the application. You can wait a long time for a client who will pay an impressive amount for the app, or you can continue to do your business. But in an easier way and get more money, because you will have more time to do it. That is why it's reasonable to use ready-made templates. So you can save your time and effort. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Using ready-made templates, you make your task easier. In this article, I will compare free and paid flutter templates to make it easier for you to find the necessary one.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
